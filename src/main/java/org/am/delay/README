Producer
========
1. Uses spring-kafka
2. Sends simple random string messages

Consumer
=======
1. Uses the kafka java API client
2. Subscribes to a partition
3. Executes delay
4. Can be scaled by increasing number of partitions and having a consumer for each one
5. A rough throughput measure shows an output rate of 3600 messages per second(laptop, local instance of kafka, single partition)
