This is a kafka based delay inducing component(Run `DelayConsumerApplication`). This can be fitted into any workflow where delayed processing of messages
is needed.

Any amount of delay execution can be done.
1. Create a new topic where messages that need a specific amount of delay need to be processed
2. Configure the delay duration for this application through the properties file and we are good to go

Atleast the required amount of delay is induced. Depending on the input rate, the delay requested may be exceeded. This
can be minimized by scaling(refer to consumer notes)

Post delay the same message can be pumped back into any other kafka topic for further processing

Producer
========
1. Uses spring-kafka
2. Sends simple random string messages

Consumer
=======
1. Uses the kafka java API client
2. Subscribes to a partition
3. Executes delay
4. Can be scaled by increasing number of partitions and having a consumer for each one
5. A rough throughput measure shows an output rate of 3600 messages per second(laptop, local instance of kafka, single partition)
